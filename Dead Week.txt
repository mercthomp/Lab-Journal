LAST DAY!!
I've been in a writing hole for days but damn it feels SO good to be done with everything today. I really hope you like my paper and that you are having/had a really nice flight. Where the machinery didn't change tones alot and there wasn't alot of turbulence! 

I really enjoyed your class. It's given me more confidence in my research because I actually understand what a lot of the information is now! So, thank you and I hope I get the chance to work with you again!

Also, if you are around this summer I would love to come talk to you more about spectrograph's!!
Expect it! ;)
