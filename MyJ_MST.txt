4/1/19 - Day one

ARCSTAT (optical, .5m, apache point) 

June 7  - final project
Proposal due in 3 weeks

rc or bash_profile file modify the path your computer is using (e.g. set up shortcuts, add in scripting, set defaults, and create commands) - these are configuration files. 
- watch out for conflicting commands

Keep a list of command shortcuts

run: jupyter notebook &
- This will run the command in the background (e.g. get your command line back)

view fits files:
- DS9
- QView

Vignette- design of an instrument such that the light path at the edges is being cut off. This cuts the area of view and makes the image bright in the center and dim in the center. 

Day two - 4/3/19

How does SSH effect my access with others?

Day three - 4/5/19 

The SSH shouldn’t effect the access

Historically the motors on our telescopes haven’t been good enough to look directly at an obj -> we needed finding charts 
- Jskycalc: Tracks motion of the sky, is a GUI from 1994…
- astroplan - astrapy powered, has much of Jskycalc but accessed from python

NED - extragalactic DB/catalogues 
Simbad - stellar version
- Great place to find other catalogues
- & you know, objects too.

When planning
- air was: Sp way of saying “how much atmosphere is between me and my object”  — want to target airmass is ~.5 — least directly above & most 
- The Moon: What the moon phase is? When does it rise and set? Moon is a reflected stellar spectrum and it impedes observation. You may need to make your observation earlier and later.
- Never have night - Sun never falls 18 deg lat 
- When is it dark? How long is night where you’re observing?
- Nautical twilight used to calibrate CCD and observe the characteristics of the CCD 

* wiki ain’t good place to get RA and DEC

Day four - 4/8/19

Find more DB’s on:
Nasa Heasarc:
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive.html

Cocalc sucks, so do the astroconda people. Meredith is a coding badass and we modified my conda config file! Which was extremely awesome to watch Meredith do.

Begin navigating the sky. Already got the DB. Feels good!

Day five - 4/10/19

Don’t use for loops use masks. Be a good python. But still use them cause stuff can suck. 

On this day we have imaged a black hole. It looks like a donut. I hope there’s a big cup of jet black coffee at its center (which its spewing out of its jets!). It has also put, what I imagine to be, some population of theoretical physicists out of work as gravity is just gravity (as we’ve described it).  

Navigating the sky is looking to be more of a pain than I thought.

Day six - 4/12/19 

Everything is broken. I should drop out. Navigating the sky sucks. Pandas sucks. Astropy sucks. (But really its super great just frustrating….)

Meredith gave us these tasty snippets:

replace the spaces in the RA and DEC with a colon 
- coords_str = quasars['ra'].str.strip().str.replace(' ',':')+' '+quasars['dec'].str.strip().str.replace(' ',':')
 

If pandas just keeps a bunch of spaces in the column names:
- quasars.columns = [c.strip() for c in quasars.columns]

A for loop says: for x, y, x in whatever do everything that comes before the ‘for’

Thanks Meredith!!!!

Day seven - 4/15/19

Arcstat dates: april 29-may 6 & may 8-11

The proposal:
* How many days, how long? You gotta be there — it is possible to set up remote

Reading science:
* abstract and conclusion first
* read multiple times
* Summarize the paper when done

Poke your topic around on:
ARAA - https://www.annualreviews.org/journal/astro

Make multiple arrays into a data frame:

My Project?:

https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aab6b2/pdf
NGC database:
https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr13/en/tools/places/ngc.aspx

Day nine - 4/19/20

What do you observe:
- accretion disks
- Galaxies and their properties/dynamics
- Exoplanet transit
- Planetary nebula: Tells a lot about the original star —> multiple star systems and how they interfere with our thought of the single star evolution we think of with the HR Diagram
- HR diagrams: Look at the population (composed of 3 broadband colors) if stars are not at the same color point they are probably at different points in their lives/ different properties

CCD - turns photon in to 1’s and 0’s  when  a photon creates an electron registering as a 1

R= lambda/ D
This tells you about the use of the bandpasses as wavelength increases the precision is either optimal or suffers in different bandpasses. 

- Look at ARCSTAT filters 
- What is your object emitting?

Differential Photometry: Comparison to a star of *unknown* star e.g. not listed info for it.

Day ten - 4/22/20

CCDs etc..
Bias/Overscan - gives you information about the instrument

Fits and such
* log or z scale
* Histograms - different regions of the image are governed by different statistics
  - Poisson = How many —> to Gaussian if sample is large enough.
  - Gaussian = deviation from norms
  - Can calc noise and gain from the histogram
* Photons are dictated by poisson but the overall flat is Gaussian

CCDs
* Bucket brigade = Charge transfer
* Care about: 
    * Quantum effeciency
    * Gain
    * Dark current=thermal noise
    * orientation of CCD
* Things to know:
    * Track linearly
    * pixels can saturate pixels
    * gain is intrinsic
    * Responsive in the optical (some ability to extend) —> material issue
Microchannel plate - know when, up to a few ms a photon, arrived 

Noise — How do we get rid of all of this? That’s the dream.
* Shot Noise - Underlying photon noise. Photons b/c governed by poisson in repeated intervals will not give you the same count
* Dark Current - as heated the thermal excitation will add untrue electrons to your count (as a function of time more electrons added)
    * Dark should be the same duration as our observation
* Read Noise - variations in the CCD readout/electronics will raise a normal distribution around the bias level. Not such

Day eleven - 4/24/20

I love spectroscopy. I remember doing a lab very close to this in my first chemistry lab and feeling like this could be my thing! That’s why I almost went into geochemistry then I found out about radiation theory and quantum mechanics and how you can determine the composition of things in the deep reaches of space using spectroscopy and I changed my major! Very happy to revisit this lab and this path! 

Also this is the periodic table of spectra I have hanging above my desk now :D

Day twelve - 4/26/20

VizieR —> Find more catalogues
* multiple submits indicate appended data

FITS:
HDU where the header and such is stored 

Day thirteen- 4/29/19

1st Draft due on May 20th - Basic plan, basic argument 

5-10 NGC catalogue biggest and brightest. if bright enough can do V_R and Halpha.   ~10-15h, dec 0-60, apparent mag (low), and ~10 arc min gals 

Catalogue:
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/db-perl/W3Browse/w3query.pl

Today we gathered data  this is my haiku about it:

Together we try
Tape, pencils, and boxes, oh my! 
Its data, I guess.  

Day fourteen- 5/01/19

Work day!

I got my objects together for viewing then I got very, very intimidated by the instructions and rescheduled my viewing. 

Meredith imparted more code to me and I love them for it:
for t in targets:
    print(t.name)

observable_targets = [t for t in targets if t.name in observable['target name']]
observable_targets

We also learned about the great travesty that is standardization of material taught across different quarters is. Emphasizing that the astronomy department is SO much better than the physics department. As well as how the graduate school is paid and a sham. 

Day fifteen- 5/03/19

I JUST NOTICED TODAY THAT ALL MY JOURNALS HAVE BEEN DATED FOR 2020…. I have transcended time and space. 

Day sixteen- 5/06/19

QE - get it and don’t do it again. How efficient CCD detects the photons
- flats with well calibrated and controlled illumination
Full well = bigger pixels —> more e —> deeper full well
- photon transfer curves —> show dif regimes that is dominated by read noise(getting just noise fo the chip — strongest source of noise), shot noise(photons not arriving at the same time — poisson list), or fixed pattern (saturation full well domination — see a pointed turn over)
Saturation types(1,2):
1. ADU saturation — your ADC stops being able to count, where the ADC converts analog to digital, basically there is a counting mismatch. 
 
read noise = voltage uncertainty
- calc sigma —> std dev of bias
- can be regional deficiencies within the CCD
Charge transfer:
- X ray Fe55 source
Dark current:
- take dark frames

Noise —> which dominates? which regime are you in? 
Read noise - remove with bias (not ideal) S?N ~S*
Shot noise - 
Sat. Noise
* bright stuff doesn’t matter too much but when you get into dim objects and it DOES

Bias frames —> subtract them!  
- is a function of 
- Bias level - set voltage your pixels can oscillate around. 
    - Don’t want it to be 0 because then the variation does negative and in computers this takes 2 ADU and now you have lowered 
- quadrant biases different due to amplifier read out
Flat field —> normalize the responsiveness in each pixel. 
- errors multiply 
- wavelength dependent (like QE)
- any filter you’ve taken data in you must take a flat in see defects in filter & DUST
Darks —> see uneven cooling eg an uneven pattern imbedded into the image due to dark current
- Need long exposure to see dc

Observation happened and I got clouded out.

Day seventeen- 5/08/19

calibrate with every move because gravity changes optics when telescopes move. 

INSPECT YOUR DATA!!!!!!

Day eighteen- 5/10/19

arcstat 11’x11’ — how big is 1’?

NCG 2998 — star forming

When you look up ra and dec it is centered at that object.
- There may be situations when you don’t want that. eg 4 quadrants reading out ea of its own amplifier, so center/ kinda center it in the quadrant (but avoid edge effects)

Spectograph
- no filters
- and it’s clearly not an image

IR flux is ~ on the scale of 1’ and 1” —> WE CARE about this scale

* display fits in the notebook: http://learn.astropy.org/FITS-images.html
Day twenty- 5/20/19
I have fallen horribly behind. My computer died and caused me sadness but things got better!

Day twenty two- 5/22/19
Work day

I got to the photometry portion of the lab I’m late on. 

Day twenty three- 5/24/19
Today was a good day I only have a few  questions on the last lab. My partner’s dad is in town and we’re going to go to dinner tonight! I hope I can get caught up on the weekend and have some fun. Sorry my logs have been short this week. My brain hurts and there’s been a lot lately. I’ll live though ;). Thanks for all the things. I’m enjoying dis stuffers!

Day I've lost count.

This is my make up journal which I greatly thank you for and will be about my experience at uw symposium.

This was my first time presenting at the symposium and like most presenters (at least that I know) I finished my poster very last minute. Putting the final touches on it just minutes before I had to send the poster to print at 4pm. I'm always amazed by how much more work it ends up being. However, I like this poster a lot more then my previous poster at AAS. At the actual presentation I must have been the one too many persons because they placed me on the balcony with the biology people and all the astro presenters were down on the main floor. I had two memorable people come to my poster. One person was a professor from Earth and Space science and I was so happy I had taken this class because he was very interested in CCDs and I was able to talk to him about the heating systems and even recommended the CCD handbook to him. The other was a professor in the astro department that I didn't know. She didn't tell me she was a professor but I gave her my whole presentation then when I began to explain what the Jovian trojans were she cut me off and said she knew, she was an astro professor, who had done astroid research, and said I did very well. Her name is Vikki Meadows and she made me laugh! I really enjoy presenting and am looking forward to presenting research I am planning with Jessica Werk next year. I hoping to plan a personal research project with her. As of now, I think I am interested in exploring CA IV as a tracer for post-starburst galaxies but we'll see what happens!! 

5 More Days til the end

We had memorial day this week and it really messed me up. Although the weekend was very nice my partners family came into town and we spent the weekend on Bainbridge which is beautiful but also yuppy town, USA. One can only hope to ascend to the yuppy status in income but maintain the mind of a nonyupper. 

The day was very stressful I had a test the first day back and once again my computer has died. I should have never trusted it again but it was my only scource to code on and now I am drastically behind in my project and I don't know what to do. A combination of my procrastination, family obligation, and computer oofs is a trifecta of behind. 

4 Days til the end

I have diagnosed a solution to my computer issues! I must create a peronal conda environment on the super computer epyc here on campus. Then using some fancy user specific flag I will be able to download the proper packages to actually reduce my data. I don't like this. My last shift at the cafe I've worked at for two years is tomorrow and hopefully with that extra time I can just bomb out this project... 


Dead Week

Also Jupiter will be in opposition on June 10th. We should all observe go observe the big boys moons!

LAST DAY!!
I've been in a writing hole for days but damn it feels SO good to be done with everything today. I really hope you like my paper and that you are having/had a really nice flight. Where the machinery didn't change tones alot and there wasn't alot of turbulence! 

I really enjoyed your class. It's given me more confidence in my research because I actually understand what a lot of the information is now! So, thank you and I hope I get the chance to work with you again!

Also, if you are around this summer I would love to come talk to you more about spectrograph's!!
Expect it! ;)
